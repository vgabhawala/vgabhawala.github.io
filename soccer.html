  <h1>Desktop Soccer Game</h1>
  <h3>Project Timeline: March 2024 – May 2024</h3>

  <p>This project aimed to create a desktop-scale soccer game that combines mechatronics, mechanical design and user interactivity. 
     The game simulates a mini soccer field where a user-controlled kicker competes against a moving goalkeeper, mounted on a linear actuator. 
     It provided a hands-on opportunity to integrate design, fabrication, and programming skills in a playful, engaging format.</p>

  <h3>Components</h3>

  <h3>Ideation</h3>
  <p>The original goal for the desktop soccer game was to create a fully portable and compact system that could be easily set up and played anywhere. 
     To test this, I initially constructed a standalone base using cardboard. By using the desk itself as the foundation for the game, I eliminated the need 
     for a bulky base and reduced the total number of components, resulting in a cleaner, more minimal footprint.</p>

  <h3>Design Process</h3>
  <p>The final design featured a 3D printed kicking mechanism and a ball holder base to keep the ball in place before each kick. After testing various materials, 
     TPU (Thermoplastic Polyurethane) was chosen for its flexibility and durability. The kicker’s infill density was reduced to enhance its springiness and improve 
     shot power. The goal was also 3D printed and designed to align with the actuator-driven goalkeeper. Field boundaries were laser cut from acrylic, allowing for 
     quick assembly and a clean, portable design.</p>

  <h3>Electronics Added</h3>
  <p>To support two-player gameplay, the system included an electronic scoreboard powered by an Arduino Uno and displayed on an LCD screen. A custom 3D printed 
     enclosure housed a set of mechanical buttons that allowed players to manually increase their score or reset it at any time. The buttons were wired to the 
     Arduino, which updated the screen in real time. The modular casing made it easy to service or modify the electronics, and the Arduino-based system allowed 
     for future expansion—such as adding automatic scoring or sound feedback.</p>

  <h3>Goalkeeper Integration</h3>
  <p>To add a dynamic challenge to the game, a linear actuator was installed behind the goalpost, controlled by a motor driver and programmed to move the goalkeeper 
     back and forth at random intervals. This movement made scoring more difficult and added an unpredictable, interactive element to each play. The actuator was 
     synchronized with the rest of the system using the Arduino, ensuring reliable and responsive motion.</p>
